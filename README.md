### *** Under construction ***

This is an IntelliJ/JavaFX simulation of the Autonomous period of the FTC 2020-2021 game Ultimate Goal.

The movements and actions of the robots on the field are controlled by three editable XML files. The real-time scoreboard shows the points scored by each robot as well as points unintentionally scored for the opposing alliance.

The architecture of the Simulator is extensible; it can support other FTC games past and future.
